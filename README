Device/ParallelPort/JayCar
==========================

This module allows you to write to and control a Rellay Controller card made by
JayCar. However it is very easily adapted to almost any rellay card.

This particular rellay card requires that you not only set the values for each
of the 8 output rellays but also requires that you strobe the address of the
card. This is a great feature as it allows you to plug up to 8 of these cards
in (mmmm - 256 rellay outputs, and 256 inputs :-). 

This means it is a more complicated example, thus allowing you to write a
simpler version from this one. This code is about 50 linues (a little over 100
with all of the POD) so it should be simple to adapt.
